Let $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{S}^d)$ denote a space of probability densities on $\\mathbb{S}^d$. For two densities $f,g\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{S}^d)$, it is frequently needed to measure dissimilarity between the two. Unfortunately, even for the most well-known distributions on the hypersphere, analytic formula for any discrepancy measure is rarely available, leading to require numerical schemes for approximation. Here we focus on $L_p$ distance between the two densities, \n\n$$\nL_p (f,g) = \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^d} |f(x) - g(x)|^p \\right)^{1/p}\n$$ {#eq-objective} \n\nand we show how to combine Monte Carlo way of integration by means of [importance sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling) to approximate @eq-objective.",
